# Lights Out Nav
This is the updated version of my Lights Out game. It now includes a nav bar automatically navigates 
to the three corresponding destinations while altering the app bar's title. The rules are the same. The purpose of the game is to turn all the lights out 
(turn all the squares black) by tapping in the squares. Each tap turns on or off the lights in the square tapped and orthogonally adjacent squares. 
The New Game button randomly resets each square to on or off and the help button will teach you how the game is played. 
You have 4 colors to chose from; red, yellow, orange and green!
